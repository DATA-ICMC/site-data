We highlight in this process the contribution of the development of the use of scene graphs and their well-structured and semantic representations. The structured approach allows better understanding of context and facilitates tasks such as image description, generation, and search, as well as identification of human-object interactions and visual question answers. This presentation will explore current studies with scene graphs and their methods, applications, databases, and what we expect from the future of scene graphs in the literature."

          "description": "Traditional data classification is based only on physical attributes of the input data, such as distance, similarity, or distribution. Here, we refer to this as low-level classification. On the other hand, the human (or animal) brain learns at both low and high levels, demonstrating the ability to recognize patterns based on the semantic meaning of the input data. In this context, data classification that goes beyond physical patterns to consider pattern formation is called high-level classification or pattern-based classification. In this lecture, I will introduce approaches to implementing pattern-based learning and discuss the development of new Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through the application of complex network theory."

In this lecture, we will explore how complex network theory, combined with machine learning and deep learning techniques, can offer new perspectives on these problems. We will discuss how networks can be applied in the diagnosis of mental disorders, prediction of droughts and climate changes, modeling of the global economy, and analysis of social network dynamics."

          "speaker": "Marcel Barros",
          "description": "This seminar presents an overview of cutting-edge methodologies in graph-based deep learning applied to the complex domain of ocean modeling. We will explore how techniques such as Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Transformers, and multi-mesh approaches are used to capture intricate ocean dynamics, handle sparse and irregular data from various sources (including time series, satellite imagery, and physical models), and efficiently propagate information across large spatial scales. Additionally, we will address the integration of physics-informed machine learning principles within graph-based frameworks to ensure physical consistency, improve generalization capabilities, and enable resolution-invariant predictions. The presentation contextualizes these methods within the Digital Transformation Project of the Offshore Technology Innovation Center (OTIC) and the Numerical Test Tank (TPN-USP), demonstrating how these advanced graph-based models are being developed and applied to meet critical demands of the offshore industry, such as robust metocean predictions, environmental monitoring, hidden variable estimation, and optimization of operations for safety and efficiency. The main challenges, recent advances, and the potential of machine learning on graphs to revolutionize our understanding and interaction with the marine environment will be discussed."

          "description": "The use of neural networks in graphs has gained prominence in various areas of machine learning, such as social network analysis, computational chemistry, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Modeling data in graphs allows incorporating multiple modalities of features, creating richer and more informative representations, in addition to efficiently capturing the relationships between data. In this mini-course, we will explore techniques for modeling unstructured data through graphs, representation learning through graph neural networks, discussing the advantages of this approach and its applications in the field of machine learning. The fundamental concepts of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) will be presented, as well as popular variations such as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs). The course will also include practical demonstrations for transductive node classification involving a real-world problem, allowing participants to experiment with and implement the concepts discussed throughout the theoretical part."
